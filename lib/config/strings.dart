In 2019, I embarked on my journey into mobile application development. Since then, I have had the privilege of building applications for a software development agency, a startup, and various freelance clients, as well as leading a development team.

My primary focus is creating high-performance mobile applications with clean architecture, but I am also expanding my skill set by training in backend development.

Driven by curiosity, I consistently invest my free time in learning new technologies, even those I may not use immediately, as I believe in continuous growth and staying adaptable in a rapidly evolving industry.
